<p>
    This application was created as a demonstration of javascript / jQuery in fulfillment of the requirements for
    project P3 for the Harvard Extension class, Dynamic Web Applications (DWA E-15). Although the bulk of the project
    involves jQuery and raw javascript, the app was built using the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/" class="external">
    Yii Framework v.1.1.14</a> in anticipation of using the framework for the subsequent P4 project. The Yii Framework
    uses CSS developed by <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/" class="external">Blueprint</a>, so that was modified to style
    this exercise.  However, the intention is to incorporate elements of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" class="external">
    Twitter Bootstrap</a> in future Yii projects.
</p>
    The following jQuery plugins and javascript libraries / snippets were also used:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://jquery.com/" class="external">jQuery</a> - v.1.10.2</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/"
        class="external">jquery.validationEngine</a> - v.2.6.2</li>
    </ul>
